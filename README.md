This is some code written by Mark. 

Main point of repo is to help Courant + Courant adjacent people start small projects.

The code captures many small details / tips from collaborators (Valentin de Bortoli, Michael Albergo, Nick Boffi, etc)

I purposely took a few things out relative to my heavier code bases to make code cleaner/lighter but should put the features back in. Main one for now is saving/checkpointing/reloading the model.

Finally, this code is still not "light" since it does provide some stuff like multi GPU. If there's interest in a Much Lighter code base with far fewer options, I can put that together.

I imagine that the way you might use this code is to make your own copy in a new repo rather than fork it and submit changes. Meanwhile I'll update it some more in the near future. Once the code settles, feel free to submit pull requests. Until then maybe just let me know any suggestions in person or ask me to give you pull/push access.
